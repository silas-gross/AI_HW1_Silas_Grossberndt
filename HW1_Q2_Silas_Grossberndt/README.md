This is the README file for Question 2 of Homework 1 for AI Spring 2022 at CUNY Graduate Center
*This project is written using Python v3.8.5*
#Overview
This project is designed to take in any two level puzzle in the form of two words being summed and output all possible solutions
#Details
	This does this by, in effect opperating a depth first search, finding all possible configurations that satisfy at least one constraint as is defined by the puzzle.
Then, the candidate solutions are tested against all othger constraints
Then the possible solutions are output
#Goals Accomplished/Not accomplished
This should be resilent against non-valid configurations of the puzzel
